# Prompt - Think of an imaginary app that stores data in a SQL database and write SQL statements that would be in that database.
# My imaginary app is a diary app that stores your username, the date, and the diary entry.

--CREATE a table to store the data.
CREATE TABLE diary (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
username TEXT,
date TEXT,
content TEXT);


--INSERT a few example rows in the table.
INSERT INTO diary (username, date, content)
VALUES ("bgrimm", "1-10-2022", "Today was exhausting so I took a two hour nap");

INSERT INTO diary (username, date, content)
VALUES ("bgrimm", "1-12-2022", "I had off of work today, so I got a lot of chores done");

INSERT INTO diary (username, date, content)
VALUES ("bgrimm", "1-13-2022", "Today was a long day at work, I ended up having to stay past 6 pm");


--Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
UPDATE diary SET content = "Today was exhausting, so I took two naps"
WHERE id = 1;


--Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.
DELETE FROM diary WHERE id = 3;
